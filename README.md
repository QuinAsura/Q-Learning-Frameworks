Reinforced_learning_Frameworks
==============================

This is a general framework that could be used to test the RL algorithms on your problem statements.
Planning to add my research code in python. 
It needs the standard computational frameworks of python numpy,scipy,matplotlib etc. I will list the extensive requirements later.
