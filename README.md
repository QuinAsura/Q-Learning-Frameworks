#Reinforced_learning_Frameworks
This is a general framework that could be tweaked to run your own Q-learning RL algorithms.

##Required
It is implemented in python 2.7. It contains an example which will put you on track for twisting the framework to suit your purpose

####[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

####[Pylab](http://wiki.scipy.org/PyLab)

##Conference Publications 
The example used to teach Q-learning RL algorithm is taking up the task to teaching a bot when to charge or discharge a battery. The results were published.
